# User Delete Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Toast Notifications**
**Problem**: The delete functionality had no user feedback - users couldn't tell if deletion succeeded or failed.

**Fix**: Added toast notifications for all user operations:
- ✅ Success notifications for create, update, and delete operations
- ❌ Error notifications with specific error messages
- 📱 User-friendly feedback for all actions

### 2. **Missing Toast Import**
**Problem**: The `useToast` hook was not imported, so toast notifications couldn't be used.

**Fix**: Added the missing import:
```typescript
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
const { toast } = useToast();
```

### 3. **Inactive Users Still Showing**
**Problem**: The API performs "soft delete" (sets `isActive: false`) but the frontend was still showing deactivated users.

**Fix**: Added filtering to hide inactive users:
```typescript
const filteredUsers = users.filter((user) => {
  // Filter out inactive users (soft deleted)
  if (!user.isActive) {
    return false;
  }
  // ... other filters
});
```

### 4. **Poor Error Handling**
**Problem**: Error handling was basic with only console.error, no user feedback.

**Fix**: Enhanced error handling with detailed user feedback:
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to delete user:", error);
  toast({
    title: "Error Deleting User",
    description: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Failed to delete user. Please try again.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
}
```

## How the Delete Functionality Works

### Backend (API)
1. **Soft Delete**: The API doesn't actually delete the user record
2. **Safety Checks**: Prevents deletion of the last admin user
3. **Data Integrity**: Preserves related records by deactivating instead of deleting
4. **Response**: Returns success message with user ID

### Frontend (UI)
1. **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows AlertDialog before deletion
2. **API Call**: Sends DELETE request to `/api/admin/users/[id]`
3. **State Update**: Removes user from local state immediately
4. **User Feedback**: Shows success/error toast notification
5. **List Filtering**: Hides inactive users from the display

## Current Status: ✅ **WORKING**

The user delete functionality is now working correctly with:

- ✅ **Confirmation Dialog**: Users must confirm before deletion
- ✅ **API Integration**: Properly calls the DELETE endpoint
- ✅ **Toast Notifications**: Clear success/error feedback
- ✅ **Soft Delete**: Preserves data integrity
- ✅ **List Updates**: Immediately removes deleted users from view
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

## Testing

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-user-delete.js
   ```

2. **Test in the UI**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/users`
   - Click the dropdown menu (⋯) for any user
   - Select "Delete User"
   - Confirm the deletion
   - Check for success toast notification
   - Verify user is removed from the list

3. **Test error scenarios**:
   - Try deleting the last admin user (should show error)
   - Test with network issues (should show error toast)

## Files Modified

- `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Added toast notifications and improved error handling
- `scripts/test-user-delete.js` - Comprehensive test script for delete functionality

## API Endpoints Used

- `DELETE /api/admin/users/[id]` - Soft delete user (set isActive: false)
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all active users (excludes inactive)
- `GET /api/admin/users/[id]` - Get specific user details

The delete functionality now provides a complete user experience with proper feedback and error handling.
