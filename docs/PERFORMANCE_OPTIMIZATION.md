# ARC Website Performance Optimization Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Excessive Middleware Logging**

- **Problem**: Every authenticated request was logging middleware validation
- **Impact**: Console spam and minor performance overhead
- **Solution**: Commented out verbose logging for valid tokens, kept error logging

### 2. **Aggressive Notification Polling**

- **Problem**: 30-second polling interval regardless of user activity
- **Impact**: Unnecessary API calls and database load
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent polling:
  - 60 seconds when notification panel closed
  - 15 seconds when notification panel open
  - Added debouncing to prevent calls more frequent than 5 seconds

### 3. **Database Query Performance**

- **Problem**: Complex Prisma queries with multiple includes and OR conditions
- **Impact**: 2-25+ second response times for notification API
- **Solution**:
  - Optimized query structure with parallel execution
  - Used `select` instead of `include` for better performance
  - Added response timing logging

### 4. **Missing Database Indexes**

- **Problem**: Inadequate indexing for common notification query patterns
- **Impact**: Slow database queries
- **Solution**: Created SQL script with optimized indexes

### 5. **Duplicate Notification Components**

- **Problem**: Two notification components both polling independently
- **Impact**: Double API calls
- **Solution**: Disabled automatic polling in legacy component

## Performance Improvements Made

### 1. **Middleware Optimization** (`middleware.ts`)

```typescript
// Before: Logged every valid token
console.log(`✅ Middleware: Valid token format for user ${payload.email}`);

// After: Commented out for cleaner logs, kept error logging only
// console.log(`✅ Middleware: Valid token format for user ${payload.email}`)
```

### 2. **Smart Notification Polling** (`components/notifications/notification-bell.tsx`)

```typescript
// Before: Fixed 30-second interval
const interval = setInterval(fetchNotifications, 30000);

// After: Intelligent polling based on user interaction
const interval = isOpen ? 15000 : 60000; // 15s when open, 60s when closed
pollInterval = setInterval(() => fetchNotifications(false), interval);
```

### 3. **API Call Debouncing**

```typescript
// Added 5-second debouncing to prevent excessive calls
const now = Date.now();
if (!force && now - lastFetchRef.current < 5000) {
  return;
}
```

### 4. **Database Query Optimization** (`app/api/notifications/route.ts`)

```typescript
// Before: Sequential queries with include
const notifications = await prisma.inAppNotification.findMany({
  where: whereClause,
  include: { serviceRequest: {...}, schedule: {...} }
});
const unreadCount = await prisma.inAppNotification.count({...});

// After: Parallel queries with select
const [notifications, unreadCount] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.inAppNotification.findMany({
    where: whereClause,
    select: { /* only needed fields */ }
  }),
  prisma.inAppNotification.count({...})
]);
```

### 5. **Response Caching**

```typescript
// Added cache headers to reduce redundant requests
return NextResponse.json(
  { notifications, unreadCount },
  {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": "private, max-age=30, stale-while-revalidate=60",
    },
  }
);
```

### 6. **Database Indexes** (`scripts/optimize-notifications-db.sql`)

- Composite index for user + read status + created date
- Partial index for unread notifications only
- Expiration-based indexes for cleanup
- Service request and schedule notification indexes

### 7. **Error Handling Improvements**

- Reduced console spam from network errors
- Graceful handling of authentication failures
- Development-only logging for debugging

## Expected Performance Gains

### API Response Times

- **Before**: 2-25+ seconds for notification queries
- **After**: Expected 100-500ms with proper indexing

### Polling Frequency

- **Before**: 30-second intervals = 120 requests/hour
- **After**: 60-second intervals = 60 requests/hour (50% reduction when closed)

### Database Load

- **Before**: Complex queries with includes on every request
- **After**: Optimized queries with proper indexing and parallel execution

### Console Clarity

- **Before**: Verbose middleware logging on every request
- **After**: Clean logs with error-only reporting

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Database Maintenance**

```sql
-- Run the optimization script
psql -d your_database -f scripts/optimize-notifications-db.sql

-- Set up automatic cleanup of old notifications
DELETE FROM in_app_notifications
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
```

### 2. **Monitoring & Metrics**

- Add performance monitoring to track API response times
- Set up alerts for slow notification queries
- Monitor notification table growth and cleanup needs

### 3. **Further Optimizations**

- Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time notifications
- Add notification archiving for historical data
- Implement connection pooling optimization
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy notification queries

### 4. **Caching Strategies**

- Redis cache for frequently accessed notifications
- Client-side caching with service workers
- CDN caching for static notification assets

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**:

- Middleware logging optimization
- Smart notification polling
- API call debouncing
- Database query optimization
- Response caching headers
- Error handling improvements
- Database index optimization script

⏳ **Next Steps**:

1. Run the database optimization script in production
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Implement additional caching if needed
4. Consider WebSocket implementation for real-time updates

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. **Check API Response Times**:

   ```bash
   # Before optimization
   time curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/notifications?limit=20

   # Should now be much faster with indexes
   ```

2. **Monitor Console Logs**:

   - Should see significantly fewer middleware logs
   - Notification polling should be less frequent

3. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Fewer notification API calls
   - Better response times

## Database Index Commands

Run these commands to apply the database optimizations:

```bash
# Apply the optimization script
psql -d $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/optimize-notifications-db.sql

# Or using Prisma (if you create a migration)
npx prisma migrate dev --name optimize-notifications
```

## Performance Monitoring

```typescript
// Add to your monitoring/analytics
console.log(
  `⚡ Fetched ${notifications.length} notifications for user ${user.id} in ${
    Date.now() - startTime
  }ms`
);
```

This comprehensive optimization should significantly improve the notification system performance and reduce the excessive logging you were experiencing.
