1. Scheduling and request
now, we are going to create around patient requesting for service and caregiver schedules (to go see patient, etc.).
Patients can request for their caregiver to come and "services" them e.g wound dressing etc. Caregivers can also schedule to go see their assigned patient and the admin can see all these... service requests by patients and caregivers' schedule and reviewers can see just the service requests of their assignment patients. this is what i want to do next... you can help me polish my idea or Ask me any clarifying questions that can allow you to be 95% successful in completing this task

2. Tasks (orders)
